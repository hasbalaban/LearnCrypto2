# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow performs a static analysis of your Kotlin source code using
# Detekt.
#
# Scans are triggered:
# 1. On every push to default and protected branches
# 2. On every Pull Request targeting the default branch
# 3. On a weekly schedule
# 4. Manually, on demand, via the "workflow_dispatch" event
#
# The workflow should work with no modifications, but you might like to use a
# later version of the Detekt CLI by modifing the $DETEKT_RELEASE_TAG
# environment variable.
